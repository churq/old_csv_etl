# Background and Overview:

This is just a very basic example to work around the different ways to create an ETL tool in Python.

# Instructions:

- CSV file will contain user data and have three columns: name, surname, email
- CSV file will have an arbitrary list of users
- Name and surname field should be set to be capitalised e.g. from “john” to “John”
- Emails need to be set to be lower case
- The script should validate the email address to make sure that it is valid (valid means that it is a legal email format e.g. “xxxx@asdf@asdf is not a legal format). In the instance that an email is invalid an error message will be reported to STDOUT

# Technical Notes:

For this example I have utilised ...

- Language: Python 3.5
- Operative System: macOS sierra
- Modules/Libraries: Please refer to the conf, requirements and setup files.

# Notes:

A sample project that exists as an aid to the 'Python Packaging User Guide
<https://packaging.python.org>'_'s 'Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
Projects <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html>'_.

This projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
